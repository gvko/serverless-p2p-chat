P2P chat library.


The task is to create a js library for allowing developers to easily integrate chat functionality in side of their app.
The JS lib, should be able to be demoed via CLI tool.

Requirements:

* A simple js lib that can be `npm installed <github link>` and included in a project with nice api.
* Show typing indicator when a participants are typing
* When a new participant joins the room, they need to see the history in order.
* Some unit tests if applicable
* Remove a user from the chat
* In the README file, describe what you could have done better, any design choices, known issues..etc
* Don't build a web interface.

Submission:
* Clone the project
* Work on your own repo
* Send link to your repo via email

Example code:
* You have been provided some examples of a p2p chat system in the index.js file.
* To run the example, `npm i` and then `node index.js`
* Some unit test are also provided.
* You don't have to use the example code as your base, you can do create your own architecture.

This is an open ended test, you should try your best and deliver as much as you can.
Code quality, priority managment are all factors.

Best of luck
